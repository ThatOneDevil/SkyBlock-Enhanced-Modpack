{gold}**Welcome!**{}  
  
You’ve just installed {yellow}**SkyBlock Enhanced**{}!  

Let’s walk through a quick setup to make your Hypixel SkyBlock experience smooth and personal.

{gold}**What to expect**{}  
  
- {yellow}SkyBlock Enhanced{} comes packed with quality-of-life mods to improve every part of the game.  
  But with so many mods, things can overlap or clash.  
  {gold}Good news:{} I’ve already done the fine-tuning so everything works well together.  
- The pack is {yellow}pre-configured{} for your resolution.  
  Each resolution needs unique configs since overlays shift with screen size.  
  I’ve included ready-made configs for **1080p, 1440p, and 4K.** The modpack checks your resolution on first launch and applies the closest one automatically!
  Look for a small box on the right showing which config loaded and if it worked.  
- Didn’t get the right one? Continue the setup. Once you’re at the main menu, open the config manager.  
  You can switch configs or import community-made ones from Discord.
