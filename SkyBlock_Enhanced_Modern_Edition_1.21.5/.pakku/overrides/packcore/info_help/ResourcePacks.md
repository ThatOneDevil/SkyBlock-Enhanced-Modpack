{gold}**Resource & Texture Packs**{}  

There are several resource/texture packs for Hypixel SkyBlock. Which one you use comes down to preference. Packs can be stacked, and the one at the top always takes priority. If two packs include the same texture, the top pack will show it. Packs lower down only fill in what the ones above don’t have. (Keep scrolling down for more information)  

By default, packs stack in the order you click them. To place a pack at the top, click it first, then continue in the order you like. If you want to change it later, go to the Resource Packs menu under Options.

> {#b2651b}Warning! Hypixel Plus requires the JVM argument `-Xss4M` to work correctly. If you haven’t enabled the pack yet, **do not select it**. Complete the wizard, exit the game, add the argument, and then reopen. Alternatively, close the game now, add the argument, and restart.

{yellow}**Descriptions**{}  

**Hypixel Plus**  
A clean, mostly vanilla pack designed for Hypixel modes like SkyBlock. It updates items and icons for better clarity without changing the overall Minecraft feel.

**FurfSky (Full & Overlay)**  
A very popular choice for SkyBlock. The **Full** version replaces almost every SkyBlock and vanilla texture for a full makeover + GUI for the vanilla game and mods. The **Overlay** version only retextures items.

**SkyBlock Dark UI**  
A sleek, dark-themed GUI pack inspired by PacksHQ Dark UI. It covers menus and mod interfaces, giving a consistent, modern look. Doesn’t always work well with FurfSky.

**Defrosted**  
A frosty 16× pack with a clean blue aesthetic. It offers a frosty blue aesthetic across items and menus, maintaining a minimalist look without altering gameplay clarity. Ideal for players seeking a subtle yet atmospheric visual upgrade. It is also available in a pink version.

**Looshy**  
A smooth, vanilla-like 16× pack made by Looshy. It keeps Minecraft’s original style while offering refined textures that feel fresh, polished, and consistent. The pack is minimalist, with no flashy recolor or item skin swaps—just smoother blocks, clearer GUI details, and a few playful cat textures tucked in.
