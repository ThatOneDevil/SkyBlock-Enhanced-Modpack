{yellow}**GUI Elements**{}  

Many mods display information on-screen via overlays. These overlays are useful but can feel overwhelming.  

Press **`G`** to open the GUI editor:  

- Most overlays come from **SkyHanni**, which has a full GUI editor. Open it with `/sh gui` or **`G`**. Move any visible overlays after opening the editor.  
- To disable an overlay, right-click it in the GUI editor to access its config.  
- Overlays from **SkyBlocker** can be managed with `/widgets`. To fully disable a widget, use `/skyblocker config` and search for its name.  

> {#275EF5}Tip:{} New overlays may appear when performing different actions. Keep in mind that what you see can change, and an area that looks empty might later display something new.  

If you need help, {#275EF5}[Join the Discord](https://discord.gg/pdwxyjTta7){} for support.

{yellow}**How to Open a Mod Config**{}  

Each mod has its own config screen. You can access them in a few ways:

- Press **ESC → Mods** to see all installed mods, then scroll to the one you want to configure.  

---

{yellow}**How to Search for Features**{}  

Finding a specific feature can be tricky. Try these tips:  
- Search by what the feature *does* (like “waypoints” or “dungeons”).  
- If you don’t know which mod it’s in, try different ones. You’ll learn over time which mods cover which features.  
- Start with **SkyHanni** and **SkyBlocker**, as they include most QoL and overlay features.

{#275EF5}**Extra Tip:**{}
