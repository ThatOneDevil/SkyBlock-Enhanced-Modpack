# SkyBlock Enhanced - Configuration Setup

Welcome to **SkyBlock Enhanced**! This dialog helps you choose the best configuration for your Hypixel SkyBlock experience.

---

## 🎮 Configuration Types

There are three types of configurations available, each tailored for different screen resolutions.

Many mods display GUI overlays on screen, and changing resolution can shift their positions. That’s why I’ve created separate configs for 1080p, 1440p, and 4K. These configurations are designed to:

- Prevent overlap between GUI elements from different mods
- Disable duplicate features across mods
- Ensure everything is clean, readable, and well-organized

All to make your experience as smooth as possible.

### 📦 Official Configs
These are carefully crafted configurations made for SkyBlock Enhanced. Choose the version that matches your screen resolution:
- `SE-4k_screen_size-Default_ConfigsV2.zip` This option is for players with 4K monitors.
- `SE-1440p_screen_size-Default_ConfigsV2.zip` This option is for players with 1440p monitors.
- `SE-1080p_screen_size-Default_ConfigsV2.zip` This option is for players with 1080p monitors.

### 🎨 Custom Configs
These are community-made or personal configurations you've created.

## 🔧 What Each Button Does

- **🚀 Extract**: Applies the selected configuration (replaces current mod settings).
- **⏭️ Skip**: Continues with your current settings (no changes made).
- **❓ Help**: Shows available `/packcore` commands and support links.

## 🚨 Important Notes

- Extracting a config will **overwrite your mod settings**, unless this is your first time starting the pack.
- Make a backup using `/packcore archive` before extracting if you want to keep your current setup.
- You can re-enable this dialog anytime with `/packcore dialog true`, or in ModMenu under  
  **Show Config Selection Dialog On Start Up**.  
  This is useful if you want to switch or reset your config later.
