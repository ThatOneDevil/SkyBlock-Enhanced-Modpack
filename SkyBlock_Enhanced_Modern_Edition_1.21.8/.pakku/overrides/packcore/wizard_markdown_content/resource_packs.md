{gold}**Resource & Texture Packs**{}

There are many texture packs for Hypixel SkyBlock. Use the ones you like. Packs can stack. The pack on top wins when two packs change the same texture. Packs below only fill missing textures.

To put a pack at the top, click it first. You can change order later in **Options → Resource Packs**.
